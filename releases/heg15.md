hekura "two lonely space pilots" (heg15) - october 2025

![Angel Katarain](/assets/Heg01_A.webp)

Hekura are a Barcelona-based duo that create expansive soundscapes anchored in ritual minimalism. With influences ranging from the ethereal mysticism of Alice Coltrane to the hypnotic pulse of Steve Reich, their music explores the boundary between introspection and bold sonic exploration.

Inspired by ethnographic traditions and the raw energy of Julius Eastman, their compositions fuse scattered percussion, shimmering textures, and hypnotic saxophone rhythms for moments of solitude and profound reflection. Hekura's work invites listeners to immerse themselves into a spectral world where tradition meets the avant-garde, offering a unique
and evocative listening experience.

Ernest and Edu met during their jazz studies at Taller de Musics in Barcelona. Their first conversation was about Charlie Haden Liberation Orchestra's "free jazz" version of the South African anthem, Nkosi
Sikelele. That bond quickly translated into a shared world of listening, respect, experimentation, and sound that crystallized in Hekura.

Edu Pons is a saxophonist and a music teacher at Taller de Mùsics in Barcelona. His music ranges from jazz to folk or from classical to free improvisation yet with his own distinctive voice.

Ernest Pipó is a guitarist and composer from a small town in La Garrotxa.
Currently based in Barcelona, he primarily focuses on music production and soundtrack composition. His influences range from jazz, electronica, noise, pop, and, although he dares to admit it, also ambient.
